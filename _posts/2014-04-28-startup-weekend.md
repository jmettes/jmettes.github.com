Over the weekend up the coast, I went to [SeaChange Startup Camp 2014](http://intoitsapphirecoast.com/uncategorized/entrepreneurs-seachange-startup-camp-merimbula-far-south-coast-nsw-21st-march-2014/) - an entrepreneurship workshop in Merimbula. It was a great opportunity to put my laptop down, focusing less on the technicalities and more on the business side of startups.

In two days (at a [beautiful location](http://www.pambulasurf.org.au/) on the beach), we got to work in teams of five through the process of idea conception, to market research and viability, to building a basic prototype - and at the end I got to pitch a viable business concept to a panel of experts.
