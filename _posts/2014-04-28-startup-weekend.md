Over the weekend up the coast in Merimbula, I went to [SeaChange Startup Camp 2014](http://intoitsapphirecoast.com/uncategorized/entrepreneurs-seachange-startup-camp-merimbula-far-south-coast-nsw-21st-march-2014/) - an entrepreneurship workshop on moving from an idea and creating a viable concept business out of it. It was a great opportunity to put my laptop down, focusing less on the technicalities and more on the business side of startups.

In two days, in a team of five, we worked through idea conception, to market research and viability, to building a basic prototype - and at the end, I got to pitch and demo our idea to a panel of experts.
