title: canvasjumper - JavaScript game
---

I made a simple little platform game using JavaScript, HTML5 Canvas, [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) and [socket.io](http://socket.io).

[Check out the demo](http://canvasjumper.com). Source code available on [github](https://github.com/jmettes/canvasjumper).

I slapped on some quick and dirty multiplayer functionality, so open it up in another window to try it out (if no-one else is playing)!
