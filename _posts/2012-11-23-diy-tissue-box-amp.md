I made a great little battery-powered practice amp thanks to the ubiquitous "Little Gem" project by [runoffgroove.com](http://www.runoffgroove.com/littlegem.html).

The schematic I used for building the amp. The main component of interest is the [LM386](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LM386) op-amp chip to be inserted in socket - a popular choice for battery powered amps.

My first time filming/editing (I used Premiere Pro)! The video highlights the build process of the amp - keep an eye out for a demo of it at the end. :-)

My recording setup: one camera on a tripod, two tablets with chairs/boxes as make-shift stands, a mic, a laptop running [Audacity](http://audacity.sourceforge.net/) and a bunch of desk lamps.
