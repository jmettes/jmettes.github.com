This year I participated in [Global Game Jam 2014](http://globalgamejam.org/2014/games/escape-library) together with some friends. It's an international event aimed at bringing people together and creating simple games in a weekend. Each year has a theme to encourage new ideas - this year's theme was _"We don't see things as they are, we see them as we are"_.

In 48 hours, we created a simple side-scroller game using the [LÃ–VE](http://love2d.org) Lua game framework, as well as all the sounds and graphical game assets.
