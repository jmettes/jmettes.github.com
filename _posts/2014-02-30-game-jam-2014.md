This year I participated in [Global Game Jam 2014](http://globalgamejam.org/2014/games/escape-library) together with some friends.

In 48 hours, along with the GameJam theme _"We don't see things as they are, we see them as we are"_, we created a simple side-scroller game using the [LÃ–VE](http://love2d.org) Lua game framework, as well as all the sounds and graphical game assets.
